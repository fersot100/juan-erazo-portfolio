                    <p>I'm a 21 year-old software developer living in Los Angeles. I'm mainly interested in the internet and web technologies. Right now I'm focusing on building a full javascript stack with Node, React.js, MongoDB, and Express.js.</p>
                    <p>I'm in love with Javascript as a language and have a strong understanding of the latest ES6 features. Working in the browser is especially interesting with how fast the tools change. I like the way the learning process feels and I think I would excell in an environment where my performance relies on how fast and well I can learn new skills.</p>
                    <p>I'm passionate about education, particularly computer science eduation for young people. I think children should be exposed to computer science at an early age the same way they are to other sciences. Computers are becoming increasingly relevant in our lives and it should be something kids just know about.</p>
                    <p>In my free time I practice parkour and rock climbing, write Dungeons and Dragons campaigns, and work on my personal projects.</p>

                                <p>DM Tools is a cross-platform electron application that runs as a window locally on your machine and helps you, the Dungeon Master, manage your role playing sessions by removing a lot of the encumberments that come with pen traditional pen and paper approaches.</p>
                                <p>I play a lot of DnD and I got frustrated having to do all my combat calculations on paper. When my players went to a place I hadn't written about, I wasn't very good at generating content on the spot. This is my attempt at putting everything you need to run a DnD campaign in your laptop screen in a user friendly way. </p>
                                <p>This app is built in React.js using Redux for state control, SCSS for styling, and runs locally on electron.</p>

                                <p>Make it Permament is the result of a hyperfixation wtih base conversions. The site hosts two games that allows users to develop a proficiency converting different number bases (i.e. binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal) to each other and a morse code trainer.</p>
                                <p>I originally built the site when I was taking 64-bit assembly in college. Manipulating hex, octal, and binary numbers was challenging for me so I wrote this tool in C++ that could help me practice. Later I wanted to make it accessible to my peers so I converted the code to javascript and bought the domain.</p>
                                <p>This site is built with vanilla Javascript and Materialize CSS for the styling. I wanted to try something other than bootstrap.</p>

                                <p>Mom's Basement is a virtual reality experience where players must race against the clock to complete goals in a virtual space using motion controls.</p>
                                <p>I worked on this project with my friends at UCSC Hacks and it was my first time ever working virtual reality.</p>
                                <p>We built the game in Unity 3D and I made all the 3D models in blender in a 36 hour window. I has to learn blender a few weeks before we competed because we didn't have any other modelers on the team.</p>

                                <p>I wanted to make something visual from scratch and with OOP methodology. It was my first time writing collisions and kinematics from scratch without a physics engine. I learned a lot and hope to work with the canvas more. </p>

                    <p>I’ve been teaching college, high school, and middle school students computer programming and robotics for
                            two years. I’ve taught private one on one lessons mainly in C++, but I’ve also taught JavaScript, Python, and
                            their libraries and frameworks. Most of my private sessions are with college students taking their C.S.
                            courses in C++.</p>
                    <p>I also teach an introductory programming class with MIT Scratch and Python and I coach a middle school

                        <p>I coordinated with a team of developers, artists, and game designers to build a prototype for a fast-paced
                                competitive multiplayer battle arena. We used the Unity 3D engine and C# but also did some research with
                                Unreal Engine 4 with C++ when deciding which we should use after the prototype.</p>
                        <p>I maintained the version control for the team and reviewed changes before merging them to master.</p>
                        <p>I wrote the entire player movement physics and half of the character abilities for several characters. I
                                maintained an object-oriented methodology throughout the project.</p>
